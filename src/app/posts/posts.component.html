        <h3>Days 1-46</h3>
        <p class="posts">Since I have begun this project weeks into the shelter in place order I decided to do a small
            recap of my time so far.
            As an introvert being sheltered in place is not the worst thing happen to me. Being able to stay home with
            my girlfriend and son has been a blessing.
            Enjoying our days together by going on walks, hikes, watching movies, having dance parties, reading books,
            and playing with trains.
            Me and my better half trying out different routines, to help cope with boredom and monotony that began to
            sink in for me around the three-week mark and her the third day(she is a social person).
            Around the middle of April, we found a routine we liked, getting an idea from someone in her mom's groups,
            we both get a three-hour chunk during the day to work on and do whatever we want.
            My Time is in the morning from around nine to twelve, her time was set after dinner around six to nine. This
            worked great for us both, having time during the day to simply work and find some meaning to our days.
            During these 46 days, I have strived to continue my programming career, I had just finished my coding boot
            camp grand circus when this all hit.
            Unfortunately I was not able to get into a position before the virus hit. I had accepted a position with a
            company to be apart of their associate engineer program, but it had to be rescheduled to the third quarter
            of the year, job loss.
            multiple jobs later with the same answer, we are waiting until the shelter in place order is up to hire.
            This was extremely discouraging for me, a recent grad hungry and eager to hop into the industry he just
            spent 6 grueling months working to get into and it can't happen because of a virus.
            I understand the position these employers are in right now, this is an extremely difficult time not knowing
            what the future may hold for the economy.
            I did not want to stop so I kept honing my skill, I developed my website, so when employers were ready again
            I would be ready to be hired by them.
            Then I moved on to updating previous applications, cleaning things up. I continued to apply and network
            getting my face out there as much as possible. I wont let this virus beat me down.
            Now things lead me here to this blog, I want to do something to help with my skills as a developer. For a
            while I could not think of anything to do for my project.
            everything I thought of would have been to difficult or needed very specific data that was not available.
            Then my girlfriend said blog about your time during the crisis.
            Fireworks, I may not be able to help too much with the virus but I can share my experiences during this
            time, and hopefully help someone out even if it is just brightening their day. I think this is good enough
            recap for my time spent so far during the shelter in place order, I am excited to continue this blog,
            upgrading it as I go and sharing my day with everyone.

            <h2>Week 7</h2>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <h3>Day 47:
            May the fourth be with you always
        </h3>
        <p class="posts"> Today was a good day, I got to run out to the meat market for some chicken, sausage, and bacon for them
            meals we are gonna have this week. I made the decision to grab some beer and snacks as well. once I got home
            to my warm and loving
            family, I dropped off the groceries and started my time.
            Today I started my blog, I began developing it and recapping the first 46 days of my adventures inside.
            It is a nice change of pace to have a project I am excited about again, I plug away for about an hour, and
            then I go into my run.
            I have been working out for about two weeks now, running about two miles every day, and doing push-ups. I am
            going to begin increasing the distance tomorrow, and I increased my push up count from 5 to 10 every song
            change during the run. I get home, shower up and continue plugging away at my blog, finishing up my last 30
            minutes with some Super Smash Bros Melee. I get some lunch, I and the family take a walk around the
            neighborhood,
            get home, and put my son down for a nap. I and Brooke have a meeting today with a financial advisor I
            connected with a couple of weeks ago, to help us allocate our funds to the appropriate places, so we can
            purchase a home and be debt-free.
            the meeting goes great and we got a lot of good info, my girlfriend makes an amazing dinner, sauteed tofu on
            a bed of rice. Once we finish up it is her turn to work, I began watching StarWars with my son cause it just
            came out on Disney plus so I had to. we finish up about half and then move onto frozen because he is only 2
            and a half so anna and else is loved here. The movie finishes and we take a bath to wind down for the
            evening, playing
            with some toys until bedtime.
            My son's bedtime goes like this, water, books, into hugs, kisses and then water one last time, then off to
            dreamland like clockwork.
            We settle down for the evening by picking up the house, having a cold one and finishing
            up StarWars.
