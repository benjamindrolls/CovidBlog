        <h3>Days 1-46</h3>
        <p class="posts">Since I have begun this project weeks into the shelter in place order I decided to do a small
            recap of my time so far.
            As an introvert being sheltered in place is not the worst thing happen to me. Being able to stay home with
            my girlfriend and son has been a blessing.
            Enjoying our days together by going on walks, hikes, watching movies, having dance parties, reading books,
            and playing with trains.
            Me and my better half trying out different routines, to help cope with boredom and monotony that began to
            sink in for me around the three-week mark and her the third day(she is a social person).
            Around the middle of April, we found a routine we liked, getting an idea from someone in her mom's groups,
            we both get a three-hour chunk during the day to work on and do whatever we want.
            My Time is in the morning from around nine to twelve, her time was set after dinner around six to nine. This
            worked great for us both, having time during the day to simply work and find some meaning to our days.
            During these 46 days, I have strived to continue my programming career, I had just finished my coding boot
            camp grand circus when this all hit.
            Unfortunately I was not able to get into a position before the virus hit. I had accepted a position with a
            company to be apart of their associate engineer program, but it had to be rescheduled to the third quarter
            of the year, job loss.
            multiple jobs later with the same answer, we are waiting until the shelter in place order is up to hire.
            This was extremely discouraging for me, a recent grad hungry and eager to hop into the industry he just
            spent 6 grueling months working to get into and it can't happen because of a virus.
            I understand the position these employers are in right now, this is an extremely difficult time not knowing
            what the future may hold for the economy.
            I did not want to stop so I kept honing my skill, I developed my website, so when employers were ready again
            I would be ready to be hired by them.
            Then I moved on to updating previous applications, cleaning things up. I continued to apply and network
            getting my face out there as much as possible. I wont let this virus beat me down.
            Now things lead me here to this blog, I want to do something to help with my skills as a developer. For a
            while I could not think of anything to do for my project.
            everything I thought of would have been to difficult or needed very specific data that was not available.
            Then my girlfriend said blog about your time during the crisis.
            Fireworks, I may not be able to help too much with the virus but I can share my experiences during this
            time, and hopefully help someone out even if it is just brightening their day. I think this is good enough
            recap for my time spent so far during the shelter in place order, I am excited to continue this blog,
            upgrading it as I go and sharing my day with everyone.

            <h2>Week 7</h2>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <h3>Day 47, May 4th, 2020:
            May the fourth be with you always
        </h3>
        <p class="posts"> Today was a good day, I got to run out to the meat market for some chicken, sausage, and bacon
            for them
            meals we are gonna have this week. I made the decision to grab some beer and snacks as well. once I got home
            to my warm and loving
            family, I dropped off the groceries and started my time.
            Today I started my blog, I began developing it and recapping the first 46 days of my adventures inside.
            It is a nice change of pace to have a project I am excited about again, I plug away for about an hour, and
            then I go into my run.
            I have been working out for about two weeks now, running about two miles every day, and doing push-ups. I am
            going to begin increasing the distance tomorrow, and I increased my push up count from 5 to 10 every song
            change during the run. I get home, shower up and continue plugging away at my blog, finishing up my last 30
            minutes with some Super Smash Bros Melee. I get some lunch, I and the family take a walk around the
            neighborhood,
            get home, and put my son down for a nap. I and Brooke have a meeting today with a financial advisor I
            connected with a couple of weeks ago, to help us allocate our funds to the appropriate places, so we can
            purchase a home and be debt-free.
            the meeting goes great and we got a lot of good info, my girlfriend makes an amazing dinner, sauteed tofu on
            a bed of rice. Once we finish up it is her turn to work, I began watching StarWars with my son cause it just
            came out on Disney plus so I had to. we finish up about half and then move onto frozen because he is only 2
            and a half so anna and else is loved here. The movie finishes and we take a bath to wind down for the
            evening, playing
            with some toys until bedtime.
            My son's bedtime goes like this, water, books, into hugs, kisses and then water one last time, then off to
            dreamland like clockwork.
            We settle down for the evening by picking up the house, having a cold one and finishing
            up StarWars.

        <h3>Day 48, May 5th, 2020:</h3>
        <p class="posts">Today was a slow start, I rolled out of bed to grab my son out of his room and lay back down
            on the couch as he watched PBS.
            had some coffee, had a run and workout, then started my time. Today I was trying to figure out GitHub Pages
            work, I wanted to deploy the blog today.
            ng deploy --base-href is not wanting to work. The console is telling me it is a CORS issue but I don't have
            a
            server set up so I don't see why that's an issue.
            Google had many solutions but it did not want to work, I was not successful today but I will come back for
            it later. I finished up my time with some games to unwind from the ghPages not working, Fortnite was a great
            way to end the time.
            I and the family went millennium park today, it was beautiful out and they have some great trails. Today I
            made
            apple and cheddar pizzettes for dinner, with a garlic butter crust.
            they were delicious and went perfectly with a nice cold beer. Me and my son started our time together and
            watched a movie, played with cars and his farm set. once nine o'clock approached we began to slow down and
            get some pajamas on for the night.
            Read some books and went to bed at 9:30, we cleaned up the house for the night and started to close out the
            evening.

        <h3>Day 49, May 6th, 2020:</h3>
        <p class="posts">Today was a faster start, I got up and around made the coffee started my time, today was a work
            around the house day.
            I started with the run, even though I wanted to wait because I had running shoes coming in (I had been
            running on flat sole shoes, not good). I got home from my run and made some brunch. Egg, cheddar, greens,
            turkey, and siracha mayo panini, I outdid myself today. after eating I headed outside taking care of the
            trash and
            getting the lawnmower out of retirement.
            After trying to start unsuccessfully, I put some oil in and let it sit weed whacking in the meantime. No
            luck on the lawnmower today ill have to look at a different day, I spent the rest of my time cleaning around
            the house and relaxing with some games. The mailman walked up with a package, I was so excited. I ripped
            open the box to find my new shoes, they were beautiful. Then went out for our daily walk, just around the
            neighborhood
            today.
            Silas went down for a nap after we got home and my girlfriend went out to get some flowers and plants for
            our front porch. While she was out some family came over and we chatted for a bit and then I began dinner
            after they left. Cranberry sausage stuffing, this was gonna be yummy. After prepping everything and letting
            it bake for 45 minutes, it was ready. The stuffing was fire, I devoured two helpings, capping it off with my
            last beer.
            My son and I spent the rest of our day outside running around the yard and drawing with sidewalk chalk, as
            mom potted her plants and set them up on the railing of the deck. It was a fantastic end to a fantastic day,
            I put my son to bed and then me and the misses settled down for the night with a show on Netflix.

        <h3>Day 50, May 7th, 2020:</h3>
        <p class="posts">Today was the day, the blog was officially posted onto the inter webs for the people to read. I
            decided that
            ghPages was just gonna be too much of a hassle to work with when I could just upload to netlify.
            It is a gratifying experience to post another application whether it be big or small, easy or hard.
            It shows that I am committed to bettering myself and keeping up my coding career instead of taking a break
            during the shelter in place. Once finished with the blog, I did some more networking and spoke with a very
            nice recruiter telling her about myself and what I am looking for in a position. Networking has been one of
            my main goals during the shelter in place, due to companies not being able to hire. I want people to know
            who I am, and see my drive and technical capabilities. The next part of my day was going to auto zone to get
            a new turn signal for my car. Once home it was nap time for the little one and after he went down I got to
            spend some virtual time with my friends and family playing some games. Once my son woke up me and him went
            out to fix the light together. We were successful and went inside to tell mom and then continue the rest of
            our time together. It was a little bit of struggle, my son is a wonderful kid but he can get very bossy like
            any other 2-year-old can, today he wanted to be extra bossy. Overall today was a great day filled with
            laughs, fun, and good work. After the kid went to bed I cleaned up the house and then got ready for the end
            of my night.

        <h3>Day 51-53, May 8th-10, 2020: A weekend wrap up</h3>
        <p class="posts">I have decided to wrap the weekends into one post simply so I can enjoy my weekends without
            worrying about
            posting every day.
            My weekend was nice a relaxed, being that it was mothers day weekend. Friday was a typical day, filled with
            work and enjoying the time I get to spend with my loved ones. Saturday was a good day, I watched my son in
            the morning while my partner went to work on the farm where we are gonna start getting our produce from.
            After she got home, we got the little one around for a nap and got a great tasting salad ready for our
            friend's house. After our son woke up we headed out, we had a nice grill out and bonfire. Simply enjoying
            company and getting out of the house, getting that small feeling of normalcy even if just for a bit.
            Sunday was mothers day and the queen of the house was treated the way she deserved, breakfast made for her,
            showered with love. For dinner, we got some take out from a local Italian restaurant. We feasted on the
            delicious meal and then enjoyed the night together until my online smash tournament. Once done I settled
            down for the night putting the little one to bed, and getting ready myself. finishing out the night tidying
            up the house for tomorrow and the start of a new week.

        <h3>Day 53, May 11th, 2020:</h3>
        <p class="posts">Today I had to drop the car off at the shop to get it checked out for the season, which was a
            nice change of pace to my mornings. After the drop-off, I took an uber home and started to work. I have hit
            a
            brick wall of sorts right now as a developer, wanting to continue to improve, I ask myself what should I do
            now? I started learning react-native but it simply was not meshing with me well, I want to continue on new
            projects and keep my skills fresh but I have no fun exciting ideas. I use my time to apply around to jobs,
            fix up some resume details, and try to learn a little more about the positions in the development space.
            After my time I got the call from my mechanic and nothing wrong, I go to pick it up and start watching my
            son after I get home. We have a dance party, play outside, and simply have a good time together. We ordered
            a pizza because we were running low on supplies. At the end of the night I do as I always do, but the boy to
            bed and then tidy up the house for tomorrow. once done I relax with a bath and go to bed relaxed.

        <h3>Day 54, May 12th, 2020:</h3>
        <p>Today was relaxed, starting with me working on the computer and doing some applying around to jobs.
            I am changing how I view the applying process doing more quality applications then quantity.
            It is giving me hope about finding positions and I am looking forward to what possibilities may open.
            After my time we went for a walk to get the dog out before we headed out to holland.
            We wanted to see the tulips because it was a beautiful day out and we needed to get out of the house.
            we walked around windmill island, taking pictures and seeing the different tulip colors.
            Once we got home, I made some steak and potatoes. It was put simply delicious my cooking skills continue to
            climb during the quarantine. after dinner the kid and I spent our time together and then at 9:30 he was off
            to bed. With bedtime comes time for me to clean up, and get the house ready for tomorrow, then it was off to
            bed for me ready for tomorrow.

        <h3>Day 54, May 13th, 2020:</h3>
        <p>It was even more gorgeous out today then it was yesterday getting up to 65 degrees.
            We spent the majority of our day outside today. During my work hours, I had an assessment for a job and then
            I did some more applying. I was also trying to think of different projects to work on to help my skills to
            continue developing. I want to do something more logic-based utilizing JavaScript primarily. Alas my time
            was up and we spent our time enjoying the outdoors, going on a nice walk, and soaking up the vitamin D.
            Once we got back it was time for the kid and I spend our time together. We had a major dance party and
            played some games together. I got out a sega genesis and played sonic and knuckles, we had a blast.
            I cooked up a chickpea and coconut curry with a bed of rice and it was super yummy. It was almost time for
            bed so to calm down for the evening I spoiled the kid with a show, we watched an episode of Doug.
            Then we read our books and off to bed we went, I cleaned up the dishes and the house for tomorrow and
            finished out my night.
